    -   대답 : 지난 여름에 친구들과 바다에 수영을하로 갔다. 하지만 도착을 하자마자 갑자기 하늘에서 비가 엄청 많이 왔다. 다행이 숙소 예약했어서 친구들과 숙소에서 맛있는 음식들을 먹으며 영화도 보고 술도 먹고 이야기도 많이하면서 재미있게 보냈었다.

    -   대답 : Last summer, I went to the beach with my friends to go swimming. However, as soon as we arrived, it suddenly started raining heavily. Fortunately, we had already reserved a place to stay, so we spent time indoors eating delicious food, watching movies, drinking alcohol, and talking together.
    -   대답 : Last summer, I went to the beach with my friends for a swim. Unfortunately, right after we arrived, it started raining heavily out of nowhere. Luckily, we had booked a place to stay in advance, so instead of going outside, we stayed indoors and enjoyed our time by eating good food, watching movies, drinking, and chatting for hours.
    -   대답 : Yes, I’ve experienced an unexpected event at the beach before. Last summer, I went to the beach with my friends to go swimming, but the moment we arrived, it suddenly started pouring rain. Since we had already booked accommodation, we decided to make the best of the situation. We stayed indoors, enjoyed some great food, watched movies, had a few drinks, and spent the rest of the day talking and laughing together. In the end, it turned into a really memorable experience.
-   질문 : 어디사는가-당신은 집에서 문제가 생기면 어떻게 하는가-부모님의 집에서와 다르게 당신의 집에서는 문제가 생기면 어떻게 해결하는가
    -   대답 : 우선 나는 부모님과 같이 산다. 우리는 집에서 문제가 생기면 싸운다. 왜냐하면 서로의 말을 잘 듣지 않기 때문이다. 그래서 우리는 해결이 안된다. 주제만 바뀔뿐 근본적인 문제는 해결되지 않는다.
    -   대답 : first i live in my parents house.in my house we almost fight when somthing occured because each member do not listen another perosn's opinion. so we couldn't resolve the issue.the topic changes, but the fundmental problem is not solved
    -   대답 : First, I live with my parents. When problems happen at home, we usually end up arguing because we don’t really listen to each other’s opinions. As a result, the problem doesn’t get solved. The topic just changes, but the fundamental issue remains the same.
    -   대답 : I currently live with my parents. When problems come up at home, we often argue because we don’t listen to each other very well. Because of that, issues usually stay unresolved. We might change the subject, but the core problem is never actually fixed. If I lived on my own, I think I would try to solve problems more calmly by talking things through.
    -   대답 : I currently live with my parents. When problems arise at home, we tend to argue because we don’t listen carefully to one another. As a result, most issues don’t get resolved, and we simply move on to a different topic while the root problem remains unsolved. However, if I were living on my own, I believe I would handle problems very differently. I would try to stay calm, communicate clearly, and resolve the issue through discussion instead of arguing.

    -   대답 : Recently, there has been a major issue in Korea related to housing regulations. The government has strengthened real estate rules by reducing the amount of money people can borrow to buy a house. For many ordinary people, owning a home is the result of their life’s hard work. However, since housing prices in Seoul are extremely high, people usually rely heavily on loans. Because of the stricter regulations, many people worry that they may never be able to buy a home.
    -   대답 : In Korea, renting or buying an apartment has become a serious issue because of strict housing regulations. The government has limited housing loans, which makes it difficult for ordinary people to afford a home, especially in Seoul where prices are extremely high. As a result, many people worry about long-term renting. To deal with this issue, some people choose to move to suburban areas, while others save money more aggressively or invest carefully for the future.
    -   대답 : Renting or buying a home has become one of the biggest concerns in Korea recently. Due to stricter government regulations, the amount of money people can borrow for housing has been significantly reduced.

To cope with this situation, some people choose to rent long-term, move to less expensive areas, or focus on saving and financial planning more carefully.
