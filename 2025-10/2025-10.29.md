-   질문 : 첫 해외여행-어딜갔는가-누구와-거기서 무엇을 했는가
    -   대답 : 첫 해외여행은 친척들과 중국이였다. 어렸을때의 여행이라 많은게 기억이 남진 않지만 우리가 버스를 탈때 중국 상인들이 가짜 명품 지갑들을 10개에 10000원에 팔았던것이 기억나고 생에 첫 중국 음식을 먹었는데 한국에서 먹는것과는 많이 달랐다, 그리고 너무 기름져서 라면을 많이 먹었던게 생각난다.

    -   대답(GPT 다듬) : My first trip abroad was to China with my relatives. I don’t remember many things because I was very young, but a few moments still remain in my memory. I remember when we were on the bus, some local sellers came to us and sold fake luxury wallets, like Gucci, ten for 10,000 won. I also remember trying Chinese food for the first time. It tasted very different from Korean food, and it was so oily that we ended up eating a lot of ramen instead.
    -   대답(GPT 보완) : My first trip abroad was to China when I was a child, and I went there with my relatives. Since I was very young, I don’t remember much, but I clearly remember a few funny moments. While we were on the bus, some Chinese street vendors came up and sold fake luxury wallets, like Gucci or Louis Vuitton, ten for just 10,000 won. It was quite an experience! I also tried real Chinese food for the first time, and it was very oily compared to Korean food, so we ended up eating instant ramen instead.
    -   대답 (GPT AL) : My first trip abroad was to China when I was about eight years old. I went there with my relatives, and it was one of the most memorable experiences from my childhood. Since I was so young, I don’t remember every detail, but a few moments really stuck with me. I remember being on a tour bus when a few street vendors suddenly came up and started selling fake luxury wallets — ten for only 10,000 won! It was hilarious because everyone, including my relatives, ended up buying them just for fun. Another thing I remember is trying authentic Chinese food for the first time. It was much oilier and heavier than what I was used to in Korea, so after a few meals, we switched to eating instant ramen instead. Even though it happened years ago, it’s still a funny and unforgettable memory.
-   질문 : 해외에서 기억에 남는 또는 잊을수 없는 경험을 말해달라, 무슨일이었냐, 왜 기억에 남았냐
    -   대답 : 해외에서 잊을수 없는 경험은 친구들과의 일본 여행이다. 대학교 1학년에 막 입학하기 전에 방학때 친구들과 성인된 기념으로 일본 여행을 갔는데 친구들과의 첫 해외여행이고 성인이라 신났다 그래서 가서 술도 많이먹고 다른나라 사람들도 많이 보니까 신기해서 기억에 남는다

    -   대답(GPT) : My unforgettable experience abroad is my trip to Japan. It was my first time traveling overseas with my friends when I had just become an adult. We went there right before starting university. We drank a lot, saw many interesting things, and it was so much fun. That’s why this trip still remains in my memory.
    -   대답(GPT 보완) : My most unforgettable experience abroad was my trip to Japan with my friends. We went there during the winter vacation, right before entering university, to celebrate becoming adults. It was our first trip abroad together, so we were really excited. We drank a lot, explored the city, and met many people from other countries. Everything felt new and exciting, which is why that trip still remains one of my favorite memories.
